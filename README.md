# Resnet_Imagenet_with_Cutout


## Overview of Resnet 
ResNet, short for Residual Network, is a type of deep neural network architecture 
in this roject we  explores the challenges faced by researchers prior to the advent of ReNet architecture in training deep neural networks with a higher number of layers. The primary obstacle was the vanishing gradient problem during the backpropagation process, which hindered the efficient updating of kernel values once the network's layers exceeded a certain threshold.

## Vanishing Gradient Problem

The vanishing gradient problem refers to the phenomenon where gradients used for updating neural network weights diminish exponentially as they are propagated back through the network. This results in very small updates to the weights of the initial layers, causing the network to learn very slowly, if at all. This problem was particularly evident in deeper networks, making it difficult to train networks effectively beyond a certain depth.

## Impact on Training Deep Neural Networks

Before the introduction of ReNet architecture, traditional neural network architectures struggled to maintain performance as the number of layers increased. As shown in the graph below, the training and testing errors were higher for a 56-layer model compared to a 20-layer model. This indicates that increasing the number of layers did not necessarily lead to better performance and, in fact, often resulted in worse performance due to the vanishing gradient problem.

## ReNet Architecture

ReNet architecture was developed to address these issues, enabling the training of much deeper neural networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. ReNet introduced various innovations that helped in maintaining effective gradient flow, thus allowing for the training of networks with significantly more layers without the degradation in performance that was previously observed.
## Importance of Skip Connections

Skip connections, also known as identity shortcuts, play a pivotal role in deep learning models like ReNet and ResNet by addressing the vanishing gradient problem. By allowing gradients to flow more effectively through the network, skip connections ensure that earlier layers receive meaningful updates during training, thereby mitigating the issue of gradients diminishing to insignificance. This not only improves the training efficiency by enabling more efficient kernel learning across layers but also enhances the model's capability to extract complex features from the data. Furthermore, skip connections enable the training of deeper networks without compromising performance, leading to more sophisticated and accurate predictive models.

## cutout data augmentation
Data augmentation is one solution to avoid overfitting a training dataset of images. 

Cutout augmentation is a technique used in image data augmentation where random square patches of pixels are masked out during training. This method helps in regularizing deep learning models by preventing overfitting and encouraging the learning of more robust features. By obscuring different parts of the images in each training iteration, cutout augmentation diversifies the training dataset and improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. It is a cost-effective and straightforward approach to enhancing the performance and robustness of image classification models.
